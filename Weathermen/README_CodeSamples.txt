Code samples can be found at:

https://github.com/dmegahan/django-redcap - my general github (not used too much at the moment)

https://github.com/dmegahan/Weatherman - That is the C++ roguelike project I have been working on in my spare time. It's a work in progress
but I think it shows my C++ experience well, including object orientated programming.

https://github.com/dmegahan/django-redcap - This is the repo for the python script I worked on during my first co-op with the Children's
Hospital of Philadelphia. It was my first real programming experience with a company.

If you have an issues viewing these projects, feel free to contact me on github or email me at dpm68@drexel.edu. I've also attached the 
Weatherman project as a zip file in this application.
